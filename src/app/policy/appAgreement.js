    title: "Service Fee & Taxes",
    body: `The cost of Nrich Learning services is open to change at any time in the future. Any free or low-cost services may be discontinued or without an upgrade option. As soon as you decide to upgrade from a Freemium subscription to a paid package, you will be billed as per the payment term you specified when signing up for the service or upgrading, as applicable. Regardless of the plan, payment is always made in advance during the time.

The company reserves the right to immediately cancel your subscription in the event of a failed payment transaction, including but not limited to internet technical glitch and/or expired banking credentials provided. Any plan or subscription upgrade or downgrade always takes effect after the duration of your current plan subscription.

You are aware that your real charge for your chosen method of payment will be different from the fee since it depends on the current tax laws in the relevant country from where the service(s) are offered and the country from where the service(s) are subscribed. The fee quoted is exclusive of any applicable taxes. Your payment gateway or banking channel may charge you a fee in addition to the required fee; this price is what you pay for the payment transaction and is separate from the company fees.

The company's services may be provided for free during a trial period, for free with a version that has reduced functionality, or under any other suitable model that the company deems fit for its business. To any version provided by the company that charges a fee, your subscription is purchased with your full knowledge and consent.

You understand and certify that the payment information you may give the business for all or most of the subscription package is yours lawfully. The company recommends you stop using your banking credentials with us when you're not legally permitted to do so. You understand and agree to hold the business harmless from any contractual, legal, or regulatory undertakings if an unauthorized person, children under the age of 13, minors, or any other terms are engaged.

The company strongly advises you to write to us at support@nrichlearning.com in such a case or cases to inform us of the incident, and the company will take reasonable steps to ensure the future use of the said credentials on our website or at purchase counters starting from the date of your communication. Any already-effected payment, however, is not eligible for a refund.`,
